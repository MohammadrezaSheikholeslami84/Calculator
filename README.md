# Java Swing Calculator 

This repository contains a Java Swing-based calculator application that provides basic arithmetic operations and additional mathematical functions such as factorial, square root, logarithm, and power. The calculator has a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.

## Features:
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Additional Functions:**
  - **Factorial:** Calculates the factorial of a given number.
  - **Square Root:** Computes the square root of a number.
  - **Logarithm:** Calculates the logarithm of a number.
  - **Power:** Computes the power of a number.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI allows users to input numbers and perform calculations with ease.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `Calculator.java` file using a Java compiler:
   ```bash
   javac Calculator.java
   ```
3. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```
4. The calculator application window will appear, allowing you to perform calculations using the graphical user interface.

## How it Works:
- The calculator application is implemented using Java Swing for the GUI.
- It consists of buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, and additional functions.
- The `actionPerformed` method handles button clicks and performs the corresponding operations.
- The calculator logic evaluates expressions based on the user's input and displays the result in the text field.

## Development Environment:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (optional)
